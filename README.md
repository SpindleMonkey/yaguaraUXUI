#Alternatives

1. The select a date view would show 4 months at a time. Ideally broken up into quarters for easier selecting without all the clicks. 
	b. If not 4 months, we would really like to show the entire year. Once you click on the month it explodes up to show the entire month you selected. 

2. As for the filters. It would depend on the actually filters. If it is more than two, we recommend a whole other modal to show all the different filters that you could select from. This would make it look cleaner and fit all on one page.
